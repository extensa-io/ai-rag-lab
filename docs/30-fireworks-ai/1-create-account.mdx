# üëê Create an account

In this lab, we will use the _Llama 3 8B Instruct_ model hosted by Fireworks AI.

The easiest way to use this model is via the Fireworks API. But first, you will need to create a Fireworks account.

If you already have an account, you can skip the following steps and continue the workshop from <a href="./create-api-key">**create an API key**</a>

Start by navigating to the [Fireworks AI homepage](https://fireworks.ai/) and click the purple **Get Started Free** button to create an account.
