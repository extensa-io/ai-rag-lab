In this lab, we will use the _Llama 3 8B Instruct_ model hosted by Fireworks AI. Fireworks gives you $1 credit upon sign up which is plenty to experiment with industry-leading models on their platform.

The easiest way to use the model is via the Fireworks API. But first, you will need to create a Fireworks account. **If you already have an account, you can skip the following steps and move on to the next section.**

Start by navigating to the [Fireworks AI homepage](https://fireworks.ai/) and click the purple **Get Started Free** button to create an account.

Click **Login With Google** and authenticate with your Google account. This will provision a new Fireworks account for you.
