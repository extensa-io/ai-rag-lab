Memory is important for the LLM to have multi-turn conversations with the user. 

In this lab, you will persist chat messages in a separate MongoDB collection, indexed by session ID.

For each new user query, you will fetch previous messages for that session from the collection and pass them to the LLM.

Then once the LLM has generated a response to the query, you will write the query and the LLM's answer to the collection as two separate entries but having the same session ID.
