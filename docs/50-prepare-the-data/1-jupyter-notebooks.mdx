# ðŸ“˜ Running Jupyter Notebooks in Google Colab

Jupyter Notebooks is an interactive Python environment. Cells in a Jupyter notebook are a modular unit of code or text that you can execute and view outputs for.

In this lab, we will use Colaboratory (a.k.a Colab) which is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service from Google.

To run a cell in Colab, hover over it and click the Run icon that appears against the cell.

When a cell is running, you will see a loading spinner appear against the cell.

When a cell is finished running successfully, you will see green check mark appear against the cell.

If an error occurred while running a cell, you will see an error traceback after the cell.

To fix errors, you may need to update previous cells. If you do, re-run all the cells following the one(s) you updated.

To interrupt a running cell, click the Stop icon that you see against the cell while it is running.

:::warning
The UI might differ slightly if you are running Jupyter Notebooks outside of Google Colab. Refer to the appropriate documentation if running the notebook using a different service.
