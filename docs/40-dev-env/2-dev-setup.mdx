# üëê Setup dev environment

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in a Jupyter Notebook in a GitHub Codespace throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/ai-rag-lab-notebooks?quickstart=1) link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few seconds as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the container, and run the installation scripts.

In the left navigation bar of the IDE, click on the file named `notebook_template.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for the lab.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the recommended interpreter.

That's it! You're ready for the lab!

## Option 2: Run locally

:::caution
During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces or if you really, really, really want a local installation.
:::

If you want to run the notebook locally, follow the steps below:

* Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/ai-rag-lab-notebooks.git) for this lab by executing the following command from the terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/ai-rag-lab-notebooks.git
```

* `cd` into the cloned directory:

```
cd ai-rag-lab-notebooks
```

* Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

```
python -m venv mongodb-ai-rag-lab
source mongodb-ai-rag-lab/bin/activate
```

* Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
pip install notebook
jupyter notebook
```

* In the browser tab that pops up, open the file named `notebook_template.ipynb`.
