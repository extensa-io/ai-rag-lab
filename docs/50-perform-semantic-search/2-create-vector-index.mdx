# üëê Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data. The recommended way to do this is via the MongoDB drivers.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 6: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_8**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.create_search_index(model=model)
```
</div>
</details>

To verify that the index was created, navigate to **Search Indexes** for the _knowledge_base_ collection.

The index is ready to use once the status changes from **PENDING** to **READY**.
